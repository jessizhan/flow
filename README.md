### Normal function declaration:
```js
function name(arg) {
    // body
}
```

### Arrow function declaration:
```js
const name = (arg) => {
    // body
}
```

### Require and module exports:
```js
const name = required("file.js");
module.exports = {name: name};
```

### ES6 imports and exports:
```js
import {name} from "file.js";
export {name};
```
